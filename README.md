Source code for this game I made

Haven't made anything in a while so I decided to participate in the Creatus game jam, it's a very simple game.

I tried to make it have imminent danger to fit the theme of "endangered."

I guess all you have to do is not die? The pointier trees have a higher chance of killing you.
